# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Pong-Game

This project implements a simple Pong game where the player controls paddles using hand gestures detected through a webcam. The game is developed using Python and OpenCV, along with the CVZone library for easier handling of hand gestures.

**Features**
Hand gesture control: The position of the player's hands in the webcam feed controls the movement of the paddles.
Real-time scoring: The score is updated in real-time as the player hits the ball with the paddles.
Game over screen: When the game ends, a "Game Over" screen is displayed with the final score.

**Prerequisites: **

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

**Dependencies: **

Install OpenCV and CVZone libraries using pip:

pip install opencv-python
pip install cvzone

**How to Play**
